PURPOSE:  Create datasets for investigating links between landcover or other spatial datasets, climate parameter timeseries, and MODIS timeseries (especially albedo)

  * run.py conducts the ensemble
  * INPUT.py contains user input: project name, directory paths, datasets, timeframe, bounding box
  * functions are grouped by purpose within Tools directory
