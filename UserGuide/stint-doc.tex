\begin{abstract}
        This document describes the capabilities and use of the 
        \texttt{py-stint} toolset for spatial and temporal 
        intersections.  The primary expected use for py-stint is 
        to produce datasets combining land-use and climate data 
        with MODIS albedo timeseries.

\section{Directory Structure}
\label{dirs}
The \texttt{py-stint} project relies on four essential directories.  
The user should have write access to \texttt{INPUT.txt} and \texttt{STINT/}. 
These directories can be located anywhere relative to each other, but the structure of each directory should be as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{py-stint/}]
        \texttt{INPUT.txt}\\
        \texttt{run.py}\\
        \texttt{Tools/}\\
          \-\hspace{0.5cm} \texttt{*.py modules}\\
          \-\hspace{0.5cm} \texttt{Data/}\\
            \-\hspace{1.0cm} \texttt{MODIS\_tiles.shp}

\item[\texttt{MODIS\_ARCHIVE/}]
        \texttt{MCD43A3/}  --One directory per MODIS product\\
          \-\hspace{0.5cm} \texttt{h19v02/}  --One directory per MODIS tile\\
            \-\hspace{1.0cm} \texttt{*.hdf}

\item[\texttt{ERA\_ARCHIVE/}]
        \texttt{era\_climate\_t2m\_1of3.nc}\\
        \texttt{era\_climate\_t2m\_2of3.nc}\\
        \texttt{era\_climate\_t2m\_3of3.nc}\\
        \texttt{climate\_field2\_1of1.nc}
\item[\texttt{STINT/}]
        Holds output directories, which are made while running \texttt{py-stint}.
\end{description}

\section{Getting Data}
\label{data}
\index{data}

\subsection{Corine Landcover}\label{clc}
2006 Corine Land Cover seamless vector data is part of the European Commission programme to COoRdinate INformation on the Environment (Corine). 

EEA grants free access to all its data/applications provided that the user agrees:
\begin{itemize}
\item
to acknowledge the source as follows: Copyright EEA, Copenhagen, 2007

\item
to display a link to the EEA web site http://www.eea.europa.eu

\item
not to use the data/applications for commercial purposes unless the Agency has expressly granted the right to do so 
\end{itemize}
A spatialite database containing all landcover classes can be downloaded from the following link:

http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/clc-2006-vector-data-version-3/


The spatialite database can be converted to shapefile and cropped to an Area of Interest via commandline:\\
\texttt{\$ ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" <path/to/output> <path/to/clc06.sqlite> -dsco SPATIALITE=yes -clipsrc <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>}


Where \texttt{<xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>} are the bounding x and y coordinates of the Area of Interest, in the LAEA-ETRS89 projection.

\subsection{ERA-Interim Climate}\label{era}
ERA Interim climate data can be downloaded from the following website. The server may require an user account before allowing the download.  

download:
http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim\_full\_daily/

terms of use:
http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim\_full\_daily/licence/


\attention
The ECMWF server sets a limit of about 2GB per file download.  Download data in netcdf format, in either 6-hour or 24-hour resolution, with a single field (attribute) per file. 

If the desired timespan will not fit on a single file, break it into as many downloads as necessary, with the start-date of each successive file one time-step later than the end-date of the previous file. e.g. if file1 ends 18:00 31. December 2011, then file2 should start 00:00 1. January 2012.

\subsection{MODIS Datasets}\label{modis}
MODIS products can be downloaded from two main sources, given below.  Future versions of \texttt{py-stint} will incorporate dataset retrieval tools and functions based on the \texttt{modis\_download.py} script from the \texttt{pyModis} project:
\texttt{http://pymodis.fem-environment.eu/}

For now the best plan is to either figure out \texttt{modis\_download.py} yourself (recommended, as it is excellent) or to (1) write a script in python or R to compile a list of files you want to download, then (2) use a command line utility like \texttt{axel} to retrieve all the files in the list.

After all files have been retrieved, ensure that the \texttt{MODIS\_Archive/} directory is organized in the \texttt{archive/product/tile/*.hdf} structure, as illustrated in Section \ref{dirs}. 

Core MODIS products such as albedo and surface temperature:\\
\texttt{http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOTA/}


Snow cover (National Snow and Ice Data Center):\\
\texttt{ftp://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/MOST/}

\section{Workflow}\label{run}

\subsection{Setup}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        \texttt{\$ python Tools/MODIS\_aoi.py path/to/aoi.shp}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
                Print a list of \texttt{MODIS} tiles to include in \texttt{MODIS\_ARCHIVE/}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item
        Create project directory
    \item
        Prepare \texttt{ERA} and \texttt{MODIS} archives 
        as per Section \ref{data}.  \\
        \texttt{MODIS\_ARCHIVE/} should be complete
        with regard to:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item
            products (MCD43A3 etc)
        \item
            dates within timeframe
        \item
            tiles identified in Workflow Stage i
        \end{itemize}
    \item
        Fill out INPUT.ex with actual project parameters, 
        then save as py\_stint/INPUT.txt
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Processing}
After completing the setup, execute each of the 7 processing stages consecutively via the command line.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Stage 1:} \texttt{\$ python run.py 1}}
The stage begins by parsing project parameters from \texttt{INPUT.txt}, as well as loading the projection and extent from the area of interest (\texttt{AOI}). Technically, these are loaded at the start of every stage, but this is where you'll be alerted to any errors in the input parameters.

The stage then checks for corrupt or missing files within the \texttt{MODIS\_archive} given the region, timeframe and datasets specified in the input parameters.

Finally, the time variable is loaded from each NetCDF file in the \texttt{ERA} archive.  An error is raised if there are any gaps or overlaps in timesteps.


  \begin{description}
    \item [Requires]
      \begin{itemize}
        \item
          \texttt{INPUT.txt}
        \item
          \texttt{AOI}/landcover (shapefile or raster directory)
        \item
          \texttt{MODIS\_archive}
        \item
          \texttt{ERA\_archive}
        \item
          \texttt{MODIS\_tiles.shp}
\\
      \end{itemize}
  
  
    \item [Produces]
      Prints a report on any issues found in the 
      \texttt{MODIS} or \texttt{ERA} archives.
      
      Creates subdirectories within the \texttt{STINT/} directory, 
      if they are not already present.
      

    \item [Explore]
      This stage produces no new data to explore.

    \item [Troubleshoot]
      Words regarding potential trouble, and how to shoot it
  \end{description}
  
\subsubsection{\textbf{Stage 2:} \texttt{\$ python run.py 2}}
This stage aggregates each \texttt{MODIS} and \texttt{ERA} dataset into
a single hdf5 array file, with dimensions [time,y,x]. 

        * x and y are spatial coordinates in dataset's native projection\\
        * d represents index number of modis interval\\
        * d=0 is the first modis interval in the timeframe, eg 2000049\\
        * hdf5 arrays are subset to the project timeframe and minimum\\
          rectangle necessary to completely contain the \texttt{AOI}

The hdf5 array files are output to \texttt{STINT/Processing/HDF/}

Constructs array file (hdf5) with dimensions [time,y,x] for each
        MODIS and ERA dataset


  \begin{description}
    \item [Requires]
      \begin{itemize}
        \item
          \texttt{INPUT.txt}
        \item
          \texttt{AOI}/landcover (shapefile or raster directory)
        \item
          \texttt{MODIS\_archive}
        \item
          \texttt{ERA\_archive}
        \item
          \texttt{MODIS\_tiles.shp}
\\
      \end{itemize}
  
  
    \item [Produces]
      *.hdf5
      

    \item [Explore]
      hdf5!  Lots to explore!  No tools yet, but some recommendations for python or matlab toolkits, where to find useful attributes, etc.

    \item [Troubleshoot]
      Words regarding potential trouble, and how to shoot it

      Stage 3
        Produce ERA \& MODIS shapefiles from hdf5 subset arrays
        * Shapefiles are in native projection (Sinusoidal \& WGS84)
        * consist of a polygon grid, each raster cell represented by
          rectangle with attributes id,x\_ctr,y\_ctr,x\_ind,y\_ind

      Stage 4
        Reproject ERA \& MODIS shapefiles to landcover(aoi) projection
        Construct spatial rtree index (idx) for each

      Stage 5
        Intersect reprojected climate (ERA) + landcover (aoi) shapefiles
        to produce lcc.shp
          * lcc = land cover climate
          * attributes specified by lc\_ in INPUT are preserved from aoi
          * era idx to speed up feature matching

        * lcm = landcover climate modis
        * modis idx to speed up feature matching
        * lcm.shp is effectively the central product of this workflow, linking
          breaking each landcover feature into polygons wholly within and
          linked to individual MODIS and ERA cells

      Stage 7
        lcm.shp used as guide to export modis and era timeseries to CSV
        * lc.csv: each row is a landcover feature with MODIS and ERA links
